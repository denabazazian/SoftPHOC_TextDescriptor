    """Removes the fc8 variable mapping from FCN-32s to VGG-16 model mapping dict.
    Given the FCN-32s to VGG-16 model mapping dict which is returned by FCN_32s()
    function, remove the mapping for the fc8 variable. This is done because this
    variable is responsible for final class prediction and is different for different
    tasks. Last layer usually has different size, depending on the number of classes
    to be predicted. This is why we omit it from the dict and those variables will
    be randomly initialized later.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vgg_16_variables_mapping : dict {string: variable}
        Dict which maps the FCN-32s model's variables to VGG-16 checkpoint variables
        names. Look at FCN-32s() function for more details.
    
    Returns
    -------
    updated_mapping : dict {string: variable}
        Dict which maps the FCN-32s model's variables to VGG-16 checkpoint variables
        names without fc8 layer mapping.

    """Returns the FCN-32s model definition.
    The function returns the model definition of a network that was described
    in 'Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation' by Long et al.
    The network subsamples the input by a factor of 32 and uses the bilinear
    upsampling kernel to upsample prediction by a factor of 32. This means that
    if the image size is not of the factor 32, the prediction of different size
    will be delivered. To adapt the network for an any size input use 
    adapt_network_for_any_size_input(FCN_32s, 32). Note: the upsampling kernel
    is fixed in this model definition, because it didn't give significant
    improvements according to aforementioned paper.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_batch_tensor : [batch_size, height, width, depth] Tensor
        Tensor specifying input image batch
    number_of_classes : int
        An argument specifying the number of classes to be predicted.
        For example, for PASCAL VOC it is 21.
    is_training : boolean
        An argument specifying if the network is being evaluated or trained.
        It affects the work of underlying dropout layer of VGG-16.
    
    Returns
    -------
    upsampled_logits : [batch_size, height, width, number_of_classes] Tensor
        Tensor with logits representing predictions for each class.
        Be careful, the output can be of different size compared to input,
        use adapt_network_for_any_size_input to adapt network for any input size.
        Otherwise, the input images sizes should be of multiple 32.
    vgg_16_variables_mapping : dict {string: variable}
        Dict which maps the FCN-32s model's variables to VGG-16 checkpoint variables
        names. We need this to initilize the weights of FCN-32s model with VGG-16 from
        checkpoint file. Look at ipython notebook for examples.
