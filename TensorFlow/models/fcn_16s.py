def FCN_16s(image_batch_tensor,
            number_of_classes,
            is_training, reuse=None):
    """Returns the FCN-16s model definition.
    The function returns the model definition of a network that was described
    in 'Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation' by Long et al.
    The network subsamples the input by a factor of 32 and uses two bilinear
    upsampling layers to upsample prediction by a factor of 32. This means that
    if the image size is not of the factor 32, the prediction of different size
    will be delivered. To adapt the network for an any size input use 
    adapt_network_for_any_size_input(FCN_16s, 32). Note: the upsampling kernel
    is fixed in this model definition, because it didn't give significant
    improvements according to aforementioned paper.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_batch_tensor : [batch_size, height, width, depth] Tensor
        Tensor specifying input image batch
    number_of_classes : int
        An argument specifying the number of classes to be predicted.
        For example, for PASCAL VOC it is 21.
    is_training : boolean
        An argument specifying if the network is being evaluated or trained.
        It affects the work of underlying dropout layer of VGG-16.
    
    Returns
    -------
    upsampled_logits : [batch_size, height, width, number_of_classes] Tensor
        Tensor with logits representing predictions for each class.
        Be careful, the output can be of different size compared to input,
        use adapt_network_for_any_size_input to adapt network for any input size.
        Otherwise, the input images sizes should be of multiple 32.
    fcn_32s_variables_mapping : dict {string: variable}
        Dict which maps the FCN-16s model's variables to FCN-32s checkpoint variables
        names. We need this to initilize the weights of FCN-16s model with FCN-32s from
        checkpoint file. Look at ipython notebook for examples.
